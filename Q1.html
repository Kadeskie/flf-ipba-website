      <p><i><b>After knowing all the problems or factors that we didnt consider in identifying a research topic, we used those learnings by combining them to come up with a research topic that consists the characteristics of being specific, narrow, timely, important, and easy to research for us to really understand all concepts that we should include in our research. This led to the creation of our finalized topic which is about the Influence of Artificial Intelligence and how it’s transforming the Digital Arts and Literature workplace in our current society. We chose this topic because not only that it is an interesting topic but also because it’s new and many people have been using it for a variety of purposes which affects them in different ways. We chose to focus only on a specific group of people that we’re going to conduct a study on for us to easily defend our research and interact with the people whenever we need their perspectives and insights about our topic. Now that we already have our research topic, we proceed on brainstorming and identifying a way on how exactly we are going to interact with the people affected and how we’re going to share the information included in our study aside from utilizing our research paper.

We were able to list down 6 common streaming content types and provide each description about them for us to have a basis on what we are going to choose for our final three that we’re going to focus on.  After analyzing each streaming content type, we brainstormed and concluded that we’re only going to focus on the streaming content types of Interviews, Podcasts and Talk shows. We chose these streaming content types since all of them are fit for discussing and interviewing a guest which in our research are the Digital Arts and Literature Workers giving us a lot of information based on real experiences and factual data.

Our survey will be given to 40 - 50 individuals who are affected by our problem and also included in our target audience which are the Digital Arts and Literature workers. This survey consists of questions such as: Audience’s Demographic Profile, Streaming Content Type and Topics Preferences, and their Beliefs, Opinions and Attitudes on our topic. By conducting this survey, it will allow us to have a clear and deep understanding about our topic more since the knowledge that we’re going to get will be based on factual data and actual experiences of the affected people.

After placing all their responses in a google sheet file, we now analyze each of their answers about our survey questions considering their Commonalities, Level of Knowledge, Interests, and Personal thoughts about our topic. After the data analysis that we conducted, we discovered that there are still a lot of people who aren’t aware about the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence and how exactly this system affects our lives. However, there are also many respondents who already have enough knowledge about our topic which is why they were able to express their own thoughts about Artificial Intelligence having a different set of opinions overall. Among the 3 streaming content types, we found out that Podcast received the highest preferred content type as it allows you to do multiple activities simultaneously.

We used one of the methods of basic research which is the 5 Whys in defining the root cause of our focused problem for us to have a deeper comprehension with the situation that we’re encountering. We also conducted an actual research on the internet to learn more why people with different demographic profiles watch the streams they watch and how this relates with our research. Since we discovered that Podcast got the highest votes for the most preferred streaming content type in our survey, we decided to use this as our final streaming content type that we’re going to utilize for spreading awareness and information to our audience. We also agreed with each other that the streaming platform that we’re going to use is Youtube as it allows us to stream in both video and audio formats, allowing the audience to either watch or listen to it.
